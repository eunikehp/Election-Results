# Page Visits Funnel

This project is one of the assignments on Analyze Data with Python track from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) website. Through this project, I learnt about manipulating data using Pandas. 

*Scenario* : Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:
- A user visits CoolTShirts.com
- A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
- A user clicks “checkout”
- A user actually purchases a t-shirt
